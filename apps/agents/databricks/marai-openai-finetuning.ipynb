           "**Laws Concerning Divorce in Marriage for Men in Terms of Secured Assets:**\n\nIn India, the protection of property during a divorce is governed by several laws and precedents. For men involved in divorce proceedings, securing their assets is crucial to maintain their financial well-being and avoid potential penalties.\n\n**Section 13 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956:**\n\nThis section specifically addresses the issue of \"secure asset transfer\" in divorce proceedings for men. According to Section 13, certain actions taken by a member of a married couple before or after marriage are not voidable on grounds of bigamy or adultery.\n\n**Secured Assets under Divorce:**\n\nUnder Section 14 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1959, specific assets are considered \"secured\" during a marriage. These include:\n\n1. The first-born child's maintenance allowance.\n2. The second and subsequent children's maintenance allowances.\n3. Certain properties acquired before marriage (Section 13(4) states that such properties remain the property of the first wife).\n4. Immovable property up to a certain value (Section 13(5)(c) states that such properties are secured for the benefit of both wives).\n\n**Ensuring Secured Asset Transfer:**\n\nTo ensure secure asset transfer, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. An order of dissolution should be issued by the court before any significant transactions take place.\n2. The individual or entity to whom the property is transferred should provide a detailed account to the court.\n3. The court may approve a trust or nominee to manage the property on behalf of the beneficiary.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. Obtain an order from the court before initiating asset transfer.\n2. Ensure transparency and accountability in handling assets during the divorce process.\n3. Consider consulting with a lawyer expert in family law to ensure compliance with Indian law and best practices.\n\n**Additional Safety Measures:**\n\nTo further protect their interests, men involved in divorce proceedings for men can consider the following:\n\n1.
